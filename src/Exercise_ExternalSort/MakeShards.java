/**
 * There's just one problem â€” the text file is so big it won't even fit into your computer's memory!
 * (Note: For the purposes of this exercise, we are only sorting 10,000 words, so they in fact do fit in memory.
 * Just pretend they don't!)
 *
 * To deal with this limitation, you will use a technique known as External Sorting,
 * which is a way to sort large amounts of data. At a high level, this will involve
 * - sharding the large file, which means splitting it up into a bunch of smaller files that can individually fit into memory;
 * - sorting the shard files; and
 * - merging the sorted shards into a single large sorted file. The merge can be done
 * in a way that does not require loading all the sorted words into memory at once.
